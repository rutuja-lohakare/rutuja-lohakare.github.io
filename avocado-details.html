            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Avocado has become one of the world's trendiest foods. According to the poster child of millennial healthy
              eating, this super food is now a mainstay for foodies everywhere. Avocado prices have rocketed in recent
              years by up to 129%, with the average national price of a single Hass avocado reaching $2.10 in 2019,
              almost doubling in just one year. The main objectives of this study were to predict avocado prices using
              the data gathered by Hass Avocado Board (HAB) - a trade organization that provides industry professionals
              with research and data on avocado prices around the world. Next is to find out pattern in attributes that
              affect the prices of avocados.
              <br> <br>
              The project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of avocado prices, utilizing a robust dataset to uncover
              underlying patterns and predict future prices. The focus lies in understanding the factors affecting
              avocado prices and leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Extraction and Cleaning</h3>
            <p>The initial phase involves extracting data from a large dataset, followed by rigorous data cleaning. This
              step is crucial to prepare the data for analysis by removing or modifying incorrect, incomplete,
              irrelevant, duplicated, or improperly formatted data. Such meticulous data cleaning ensures accuracy in
              the subsequent analysis and modeling stages.</p>

            <h3>Exploratory Analysis</h3>
            <p>The exploratory analysis phase concentrates on identifying seasonal patterns in avocado prices. This part
              of the analysis uses time series forecasting techniques to observe constant patterns that frequently occur
              year to year and month to month in both conventional and organic types of avocados. Tools such as dplyr,
              ggplot2, and DataExplorer in R are utilized for this analysis, enabling a detailed understanding of the
              data's temporal dynamics.
            </p>

            <h3>Applying DMBI/ML Algorithms</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span>Linear Regression</span>: Linear regression is employed to predict the value of a continuous
                variable (Y) based on one or more input predictor variables (X). The aim is to establish a mathematical
                relationship between the response variable and the predictors. The model is used to ascertain the
                importance of features by examining their coefficients. A significant coefficient indicates a spaner
                impact of the corresponding feature on the prediction.
              </li>
              <li><span>Decision Tree Regressor</span>: This algorithm is used to further classify and predict
                avocado prices. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the decision tree is built on
                the training set. Predictions are then made on the testing set, and the model's accuracy is evaluated
                using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error
                (MAE). A lower MSE indicates that the model's predictions are accurate and close to the actual values.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
              The results from linear regression confirm the hypothesis that avocado prices tend to decrease as volume
              sold increases, with the negative coefficient being statistically significant. Both conventional and
              organic types of avocados follow this trend. The decision tree regressor also shows good predictive
              accuracy, as indicated by the low MSE value. These results are pivotal for understanding market dynamics
              and can guide decision-making in the avocado supply chain.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The project demonstrates the effectiveness of using R for analyzing and designing various algorithms on
              datasets. R's capabilities extend beyond predictive modeling to include exploratory data analysis and data
              preprocessing. It's particularly adept at handling large datasets and can be used to work on smaller
              subsets of data to prevent issues like overfitting. The application of both linear regression and decision
              tree algorithms provides a comprehensive view of the factors influencing avocado prices and their
              prediction.
