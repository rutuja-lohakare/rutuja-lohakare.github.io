                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project tackled the challenge of ensuring equitable and transparent property valuation
                            in Cook County, Illinois. It aimed to develop a statistical model that could accurately
                            predict fair market prices, particularly in lower socioeconomic areas. The project endeavors
                            to provide fairer property assessments for homeowners, ultimately contributing to a more
                            just and transparent valuation process.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span>Data Cleaning:</span> Large datasets like "historic_property_data" containing
                                50,000
                                recent sales and a "codebook" defining relevant variables were utilized. The process
                                involved removing non-predictive attributes according to the codebook and
                                eliminating duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    Missing Value Imputation:
                                </span>
                                To address missing data, the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method was used for
                                time-sensitive features like neighborhood and
                                town codes, while the mean of respective columns was used to impute missing numeric
                                values.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    Variable Selection:
                                </span>
                                Focusing on location dimensions and flood risk, the selection
                                process prioritized using numerical scales to avoid conversions and facilitate
                                analysis. Correlation matrices and Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) helped identify
                                and remove highly correlated variables, preventing the model from being misled by
                                redundant information.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Modeling and Evaluation</h3>
                        <The>
                            A combination of modeling techniques was employed, including linear regression, random
                            forest, and lasso regression. Cross-validation methods were meticulously applied to enhance
                            the models' accuracy and ensure their robustness across different data subsets. This
                            exploration of diverse techniques allowed for a deeper understanding of the data's
                            underlying patterns and relationships.
                            <br> <br>
                            The final stage involved a rigorous evaluation of the models' performance using Mean Squared
                            Error (MSE) as the primary metric. This metric quantified the difference between predicted
                            and actual values, providing insights into the models' effectiveness in accurately
                            estimating fair market prices. The evaluation also identified areas for further improvement,
                            such as incorporating additional predictors related to construction quality to refine the
                            model's accuracy further.</p>
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>This project adopted a comprehensive and data-driven approach, combining advanced data
                                preprocessing techniques, strategic variable selection, diverse modeling methods, and
                                thorough evaluation. This multi-faceted approach aimed to address the challenges faced
                                by
                                the Cook County Assessor's Office in predicting fair market prices for homes, ultimately
                                contributing to a more equitable and transparent valuation system in the county.
