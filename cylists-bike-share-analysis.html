                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the competitive world of bike-sharing, maximizing customer loyalty is crucial.
                            This project delved into the usage patterns of Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share
                            company, aiming to
                            understand and differentiate between annual members and casual riders.
                            <br> <br>
                            By analyzing the usage
                            patterns of both groups across 6,000 bicycles and 700 stations, this project
                            provides valuable insights to inform Cyclistic's marketing strategies, ultimately targeting
                            casual riders and increasing conversions to annual memberships.
