                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a Supply Chain Logistics dataset, focusing
                            on analyzing a Supply Chain Logistics dataset to enhance decision-making and
                            optimize processes within the sector. By creating a data dictionary, addressing vital
                            business questions, and developing predictive models using machine learning techniques, the
                            project aimed to derive actionable insights for improved efficiency and profitability.

                        <h3>Business Questions</h3>
                        <p>Five key business questions were addressed.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Plant Capacity vs. Daily Order Demand
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span>Analysis:</span> Daily order data was compared with plant capacities to
                                        determine if plants operate at full capacity and can handle demand efficiently.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span>Findings:</span> Plants 04, 13, and 16 met their daily order demand, while
                                        others experienced overcapacity. This highlights the need for capacity
                                        optimization
                                        or order redistribution to enhance efficiency and avoid delivery delays.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                        <span>Analysis:</span> Daily order data was compared with plant capacities to
                                        determine if plants operate at full capacity and can handle demand efficiently.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span>Findings:</span> Plants 04, 13, and 16 met their daily order demand, while
                                        others experienced overcapacity. This highlights the need for capacity
                                        optimization or order redistribution to enhance efficiency and avoid delivery
                                        delays.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>
                                Carrier and Route Delays
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span>Analysis:</span> Carriers and routes with the highest shipment delays were
                                        identified. Additionally, average delays across service levels (Door to Door,
                                        Door to Port, Customer Referred Freight) were examined.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span>Findings:</span> Carrier 'V444_0' and the 'DTP' service level displayed
                                        the highest estimated delays. This information is crucial for addressing
                                        logistical challenges and improving delivery efficiency, particularly for DTP
                                        services.
                                    </li>

                                        <span>Analysis:</span> The weight distribution per route and service level
                                        handling high volumes was investigated, along with the top 10 products sold per
                                        route.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span>Findings:</span> The DTP service level managed the highest volume on the
                                        Port 04 to Port 09 route, while CRF handled the most significant volume on the
                                        Port 09 to Port 09 route. This information facilitates informed decisions
                                        regarding route and service level planning based on volume demands.

                                        modes (air, ground) were examined.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span>Findings:</span> Carrier V444_0 was more cost-effective for air travel,
                                        whereas Carrier V444_1 was found to be cost-effective for aerial transport. This
                                        guides informed decision-making about carrier selection for different modes,
                                        maximizing cost efficiency.
